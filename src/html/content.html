<p>No, Angel, it&#39;s not you. Don&#39;t be ridiculous. Martha Stewart isn&#39;t a demon. She&#39;s a witch.</p>
<p>Okay, at this point you&#39;re abusing sarcasm. This distress call wouldn&#39;t be taking place in someone&#39;s pants, would it? Since when do they have orgies, and why aren&#39;t I on the mailing list? </p>
<p>No need, little lady, your tears of gratitude are enough for me. Who&#39;s calling me? Everybody I know lives here. Well, excuse me, Mr. I-spent-the-sixties-in-an-electric-Kool-Aid-funky-Satan-groove!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve seen the best and the worst of you. Did you know that the only animal in the animals crackers that has clothes is the monkey? We&#39;ll have to call it early quantum state phenomenon. Only way to fit 5000 species of mammal on the same boat. </p>
<p>The brain is kept in a fear-induced, adrenaline-fueled overdrive state, like a problem you can&#39;t solve. Frankly, it&#39;s ludicrous to have these interlocking bodies and not...interlock. Welcome to the nancy tribe. We live in a space ship, dear.</p>

The brain is kept in a fear-induced, adrenaline-fueled overdrive state, like a problem you can&#39;t solve. And I understand with perfect clarity exactly what you are. Somebody put her tiny little thinking cap on!</p>
<p>I wanna hurt you, but I can&#39;t resist the sinister attraction of your cold and muscular body! So we&#39;ll integrate non-progressional evolution theory with God&#39;s creation of Eden. Don&#39;t care much for fancy parties. Too rough.</p>
